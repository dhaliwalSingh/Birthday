                        On this special day, I want you to know just how deeply you are loved. Your laughter is my favorite sound, your smile my favorite sight, and your happiness my greatest wish.
                        <br /><br />
                        Even from afar, I feel so close to you. I think of all the beautiful memories we will made and all the dreams we’ve yet to live. You make my life brighter just by being in it, and I can’t wait for the day I get to say all of this to you in person.
                        <br /><br />
                        May this birthday be the beginning of a year filled with love, adventure, and everything your heart desires.
